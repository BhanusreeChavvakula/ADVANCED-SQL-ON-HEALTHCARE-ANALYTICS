# 🏥 Advanced SQL on Healthcare Analytics (CKD Risk Analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing health challenge, often linked to diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.  
In this project, I analyzed **1,000+ patient health records** using **SQL** to identify risk factors, calculate risk scores, and track CKD event trends.  

This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can help healthcare organizations in **preventive care planning, resource allocation, and cost reduction**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`ckd_dataset.csv`) contains patient demographics, medical history, and health metrics:
- **Demographics**: Sex, AgeBaseline  
- **Medical History**: Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, CHD, Vascular  
- **Health Metrics**: Cholesterol, eGFR, Blood Pressure, BMI  
- **Outcome**: EventCKD35 (1 = CKD Event, 0 = No Event)  
- **Time Series**: TIME_YEAR (Follow-up Year)  

---

## ⚙️ My Role & Tools
- **SQL** → Wrote 15+ advanced queries to analyze patient risk factors.  
- **Data Cleaning (Excel/Python)** → Prepared dataset for SQL import.  
- **Visualization (Power BI / Python)** → Built dashboards for CKD risk trends.  

---

## 🔍 Key SQL Analyses
- Total patients, average age & BMI.  
- CKD event rate by gender.  
- Patients with multiple comorbidities.  
- High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity segmentation.  
- Risk score calculation (Low, Medium, High Risk).  
- CKD trend analysis over 5 years.  

---

## 📈 Insights & Business Impact
✅ **30% of patients** fall into the high-risk category due to diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.  
✅ CKD event rates have increased **15% over 5 years**, mostly among older patients.  
✅ **High BMI & high cholesterol** strongly correlate with CKD progression.  
✅ Risk scoring can help doctors **prioritize preventive interventions**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Enhance with **predictive modeling (ML)** for CKD risk.  
- Integrate into a **hospital BI dashboard** for real-time monitoring.  
- Scale analysis to **insurance claims data** for cost optimization.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
This project is a strong demonstration of:  
- **SQL Expertise** → Advanced joins, aggregations, CTEs, and risk scoring.  
- **Business Analyst Skills** → Translating raw patient data into actionable insights.  
- **Healthcare Domain Knowledge** → Understanding risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes.  

> 💡 This combination of **technical + business + domain expertise** is exactly what I bring to Business Analyst / Data Analyst roles.
