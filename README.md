## Project Overview
This project leverages **advanced SQL queries** to analyze healthcare data, specifically focusing on **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients**. The goal is to identify patterns, high-risk patients, and actionable insights that can help healthcare providers improve patient care and resource allocation.

---

## Dataset
- File: `ckd_dataset.csv`  
- Source: Public healthcare dataset with patient demographics, medical test results, and CKD indicators.  
- Features include: age, blood pressure, blood sugar, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and CKD diagnosis.

---

## SQL Queries
The repository contains multiple SQL queries organized to answer key healthcare questions.

| Query Name | Purpose | Sample Outcome |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| `ckd_high_risk.sql` | Identifies high-risk CKD patients | 120 patients flagged |
| `ckd_demographics.sql` | Analyzes patient demographics by CKD stage | Age and gender distribution chart |
| `ckd_lab_analysis.sql` | Summarizes lab results for CKD diagnosis | Average hemoglobin & creatinine by stage |
| `ckd_comorbidities.sql` | Identifies common comorbidities among CKD patients | Diabetes and hypertension trends |
| `ckd_treatment_patterns.sql` | Analyzes treatment patterns by stage | Medication frequency & follow-up insights |

> *Tip: Replace sample outcomes with actual query results after running.*

## Key Insights & Impact
- Quickly identifies **patients at highest risk** of CKD complications.  
- Highlights **demographic trends** for targeted interventions.  
- Provides **actionable lab and comorbidity analysis** for healthcare decision-making.  
- Serves as a strong example of **business impact through SQL analytics**.

---

## Skills & Tools
